# - If serving the UI over HTTPS and your REST API is HTTP, set this to 
#   a relative path like /api and configure the reverse proxy to forward to your REST.
# - For local dev, set to your REST endpoint and Vite will proxy /api to it.
VITE_REST_API_URL=http://localhost:1317

## Tendermint RPC URL for Keplr suggestion (optional)
