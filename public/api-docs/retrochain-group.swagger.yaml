                          representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field\n`value` which holds the custom JSON in addition\
                          \ to the `@type`\nfield. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\"\
                          ,\n      \"value\": \"1.212s\"\n    }"

                    \ by default use\n'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack\nmethods only use the fully qualified\
                    \ type name after the last '/'\nin the type URL, for example \"foo.bar.com/x/y.z\" will yield type\nname \"y.z\".\n\nJSON\n\
                    \nThe JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular\nrepresentation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an\n\
                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:\n\n    package google.profile;\n    message Person {\n    \
                    \  string first_name = 1;\n      string last_name = 2;\n    }\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person\"\
                    ,\n      \"firstName\": <string>,\n      \"lastName\": <string>\n    }\n\nIf the embedded message type is well-known and has\
                    \ a custom JSON\nrepresentation, that representation will be embedded adding a field\n`value` which holds the custom JSON\
                    \ in addition to the `@type`\nfield. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\"\
                    ,\n      \"value\": \"1.212s\"\n    }"
