                    \ a custom JSON\nrepresentation, that representation will be embedded adding a field\n`value` which holds the custom JSON\
                    \ in addition to the `@type`\nfield. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\"\

                        \  breaking changes.)\n\nNote: this functionality is not currently available in the official\nprotobuf release, and it\

                    \ additional generated methods of the Any type.\n\nExample 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.\n\n    Foo foo = ...;\n  \
                    \  Any any;\n    any.PackFrom(foo);\n    ...\n    if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {\n      ...\n    }\n\nExample 2: Pack and unpack\

                    \    }\n\nExample 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.\n\n    foo = Foo(...)\n    any = Any()\n    any.Pack(foo)\n    ...\n\
                    \    if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):\n      any.Unpack(foo)\n      ...\n\nExample 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go\n\n     foo\
                    \ := &pb.Foo{...}\n     any, err := anypb.New(foo)\n     if err != nil {\n       ...\n     }\n     ...\n     foo := &pb.Foo{}\n\
                    \     if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {\n       ...\n     }\n\nThe pack methods provided by protobuf library will\
                    \ by default use\n'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack\nmethods only use the fully qualified\
                    \ type name after the last '/'\nin the type URL, for example \"foo.bar.com/x/y.z\" will yield type\nname \"y.z\".\n\nJSON\n\
                    \nThe JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular\nrepresentation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an\n\
                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:\n\n    package google.profile;\n    message Person {\n    \
                    \  string first_name = 1;\n      string last_name = 2;\n    }\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person\"\
                    ,\n      \"firstName\": <string>,\n      \"lastName\": <string>\n    }\n\nIf the embedded message type is well-known and has\
                    \ a custom JSON\nrepresentation, that representation will be embedded adding a field\n`value` which holds the custom JSON\
                    \ in addition to the `@type`\nfield. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\"\
                    ,\n      \"value\": \"1.212s\"\n    }"
